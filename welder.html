    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Welder trade is one of the most hands-on and practical courses in ITI. It involves learning the techniques of joining metal parts using various types of welding processes such as gas welding, arc welding, TIG, and MIG welding. Welding is a critical skill required in almost every industry involving metalwork, construction, fabrication, or machinery.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
    <p>
      In this trade, students are trained in the principles of welding, different types of joints, handling welding tools and machines, gas cutting, sheet metal work, and safety precautions. You will also learn how to read technical drawings, select appropriate welding methods, and perform quality checks to ensure strong, precise, and clean welds.
    </p>

    <h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      Welder trade graduates have vast opportunities in construction sites, shipbuilding yards, automobile industries, railways, pipelines, oil and gas industries, and manufacturing plants. Welders are essential for building bridges, buildings, industrial structures, and machines. With additional certifications and experience, one can become a welding inspector, supervisor, or even work overseas where skilled welders are in high demand.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Duration and Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The course duration for the Welder trade is 1 year (2 semesters). Candidates who have passed their 8th or 10th standard can enroll, depending on the institute. Itâ€™s a great option for students who want a quick start to a practical career. No prior experience is required, but an interest in working with machines and metal is helpful.
    </p>

    <h2>Higher Education and Growth</h2>
    <p>
      After completing this trade, students can pursue short-term certification courses in advanced welding techniques or enroll in diploma courses in mechanical or welding technology. They can also prepare for government job exams or start their own welding workshops. Over time, skilled welders can advance to become foremen, supervisors, or quality controllers in large industrial setups.
