    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      The Machinist trade is one of the core mechanical trades that focuses on the operation of machine tools such as lathes, milling machines, grinding machines, and other precision equipment. This trade trains students in metal cutting, shaping, and manufacturing components with exact dimensions and finishes. Machinists are the backbone of the manufacturing industry.
    </p>

    <h2>What You Will Learn</h2>
    <p>
      In the Machinist course, students learn about reading engineering drawings, setting up and operating machines, measuring and marking tools, lathe operations, milling, drilling, grinding, maintenance of machines, and safety practices. Practical workshops help in understanding precision machining, which is vital in producing machine parts, tools, and components.
    </p>

    <h2>Career Opportunities</h2>
    <p>
      After completing the Machinist trade, students can work in manufacturing industries, railways, workshops, automobile sectors, aerospace companies, tool rooms, and government or private factories. Job roles include machinist, machine operator, toolmaker, production technician, or quality controller. With time and experience, students can become supervisors or start their own machine shop.
    </p>

    <h2>Course Duration and Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      The Machinist course is typically 2 years (4 semesters). Students who have passed Class 10 with Mathematics and Science are eligible. The course is ideal for students who enjoy working with machines and have a strong interest in mechanical systems and tools.
    </p>

    <h2>Higher Education and Growth</h2>
    <p>
      Students can pursue diploma or engineering courses in Mechanical Engineering after Machinist. They can also take certification courses in CNC programming, CAD/CAM design, or precision machining. With further studies and experience, students can progress into roles such as Production Manager, Design Engineer, or Mechanical Supervisor.
